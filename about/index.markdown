# The Site

Oh hello there and welcome to my webpage/blog/thingie. It's a place where I can practice my [writing][blog] and where I can store the [games][] I make. You can find other stuff on my [projects][] page or on [github][]. This site is built with [Jekyll][] and it's also [hosted on github][site_repo].

# Me

My name is Jonas hietala and I'm currently studying Computer Science at Link√∂pings University and I do like it here. It's a mix of new stuff, fun stuff and admittedly some boring stuff. Math, programming and generally building stuff makes me happy but assignments and exams makes me less happy. Out of school I like to read, practice taekwon-do and play games.

And most of all I like programming. I enjoy low level as much as high level, dynamic vs static are both good and fun and I think OO has as much value as functional programming. I'm all about the challenge and problem solving.

I think the most rewarding thing in life is to learn something, which might be the reason why my bookshelf is overflowing with programming and school books. I've actually made a point to never sell my off my school books like many others seem to be doing. Check out my [book recommendations][].
