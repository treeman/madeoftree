Oh hello there and welcome to my webpage/blog/thingie. It's a place where I can practice my [writing][blog] and where I can store the [games][] I make.

I'm currently studying Computer Science at Link√∂pings University and I kinda like it here. We have math and other fun courses but I have a lot of fun stuff off school, like collecting manga, practicing taekwon-do, programming and just enjoying life.

I've been programming a couple of years now and I think the most rewarding thing in life is to learn something. It might be the reason to why my bookshelf is being overflowed with programming and school books, I've made it a point to never sell my off my school books like many other seem to be doing. Check out my [book recommendations][].
