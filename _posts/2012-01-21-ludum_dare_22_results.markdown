[The results][res] from [Ludum Dare 22][] are in! I made the game [Sat-E][] for the 48 hour competition and I was [quite happy][postmortem] with it.

**#24 Community 3.71**  
This one was really surprising, but welcome. I did post a cute picture of a korean k-pop star so I guess that's why.

**#40 Fun 3.38**  
Fun is always great! I'm so happy ^^

**#49 Theme 3.69**  
I thought my theme choice (Wall-E in space) was good, seems like other thought that too.

**#65 Overall 3.42**  
This is supposedly the "best" category to do well in so I'm glad. I did a lot better than I thought I would...

**#95 Humor 2.82**  
Damned blast I should've focus more on the funny one-liners.

**#167 Mood 2.92**  
If I make a better version of the game this is probably the one thing I would focus on. But that is a thought for another time.

**#247 Innovation 2.69**  
Not very innovating I agree.

**#338 Audio 2.23**  
No music = shit.

**#340 Graphics 2.62**  
I guess I'm not that good of an artist, but tell me something I don't know!ยง

**#376 Coolness 35%**  
The coolness factor = amount of games rated. I wasn't motivated at all sadly... I'm a game developer but I don't play much games? I'm so strange.
