I was looking forward to this weekend, for Ludum Dare and for me to finally make a game again. But it just don't feel right to me. I'm not prepared, I feel a little bit stressed and I don't really have faith in my game so I'm gonna step down this one as well. But it's fine, Ludum Dare is supposed to be fun and challenging with an emphasis on fun but as it is now I just don't really feel it.

Next time I will come more prepared, that's a must! I think I need to do some html5 or pygame for the next time. Fast prototyping should mean more than writing a lot of boilerplate code and the boiler will make a damn stew if you're rusty.
