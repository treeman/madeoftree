Today it's finally starting again and it's off with a flying start. We have 11 lectures this first week and an absolutely smacked schedule. If that wasn't enough I also have a mentor time to prepare for and I need to start Taekwon-do again.

On another note IÍ„'m currently plowing through 'Liar Game' manga which is pretty damn nice. It's a psychological manga about various games where you're supposed to lie and cheat your way to victory. Corny as it may sound it's pretty good.
