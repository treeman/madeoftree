So I read the wonderful [Design for Hackers](http://www.designforhackers.com/) and I managed to win some money for books from a course... So I ran away and ordered some new books, and they just arrived today. Yay!

First off I ordered [Introduction to Algorithms](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0070131511/) which is the de facto book about algorithms and it seemed like a fitting thing to do as I won it by doing algorithm assignments.

Secondly I've been wanting to grab [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) for a while and I finally did. It's one of the classical computer books you *have* to read once in your life (or so they say).

I wasn't going to get a third book, but on [adlibris](http://adlibris.com/) where I got the vouchers you couldn't pay with two vouchers on one order. So I had to split it up and it felt kinda dumb to not use it all... So I ordered a third book. I had no idea what book to get though, but [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711/what-is-the-single-most-influential-book-every-programmer-should-read) came to the rescue! It's a bunch of answers to the question "What is the single most influential book every programmer should read?" and is like a top X list for programming books.

Incidentally I've got a few of those already, and the two I've already decided on was there (SICP is 3rd, Introduction to Algorithms 5th). Of course I wanted to get either the 1st or 2nd and I ended up choosing the 2nd one, [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer) just because it seemed a bit easier to read. I've got a ton of fairly hardcore programming books I need to plow through so something a bit easier to digest should be welcome.

Go go programming books!
