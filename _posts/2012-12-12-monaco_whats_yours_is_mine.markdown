{% excerpt %}

I've been waiting for soon to be three years for [Monaco What's Yours is Mine][monaco], and today I was granted an early christmas present - I was given a beta key! w00p!!

I was planning on studying and sending some emails to some companies... But who knows what I'll end up doing?

Tomorrow is preorder release, yes I'm going to buy a 4-pack directly, and they will also stream etc. But for new enjoy the 10 month old gameplay video!
