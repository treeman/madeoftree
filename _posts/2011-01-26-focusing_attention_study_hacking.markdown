A week of drawing is over, but I didn't draw that much. It was a little bit of a fail from my part.

But the past is the past and this week I'm going to be study focused. Not that I need to study, but I really need to rework my study technique. I've been going on like a classical student, in the bad sense, by skipping class and getting super stressed when the tests and deadlines are over me. Somehow you manage with some last-minute studying and all is well.

Well not really. I already have a bad stomach and stress makes it a lot worse. Even if I didn't have this problem stress is never good, especially not when you *need* to take this test or finish this assignment *for tomorrow*. It screws with my health, my study results and it intrudes on my free time far too much I'd say.

This is when I dusted an old bookmark I found a long time ago: [Study Hacks][1]. It's some guy who writes about studying and study technique and he's got [some](http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/04/18/how-to-become-a-zen-valedictorian-decreasing-your-stress-without-decreasing-your-ambition/) [pretty](http://calnewport.com/blog/2009/03/09/the-straight-a-method-how-to-ace-college-courses/) [good](http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/09/27/how-double-majors-can-ruin-your-life-two-arguments-for-doing-less/) [ideas](http://calnewport.com/blog/2009/03/27/what-the-hell-is-study-hacks/). This is what I'll focus on this week: to change my routines and take control over my studies and don't let them control me.

Here's a little rundown of the main principles from [Study Hacks][1] as I understand them;

**Do fewer things**  
Sure it makes sense. When I signed up for an extra course last year I felt pretty damn stressed and I couldn't really focus on my other courses knowing I had this extra class I missed to catch up with. It was even on my mind when I tried to do other things and when I got my stumach problems I decided to drop it. That was seriously a pretty damn good decision: I felt a lot better with it gone.

**Do them better**  
Also what are good grades? They should show your skill but if they're good they should also impress. And what are you most impressed by? Someone with straight-A or someone who's read 40 points more but with slightly worse grades? I think we're more impressed by deep knowledge in a smaller area (better grades in fewer courses) than by someone who's a know-it-all but specialist-in-nothing. Maybe it's a good idea to focus on getting really good grades instead of trying to do too much at once and risk to spread out too much?

**Know why you're doing them**  
Lastly it makes sense why you should know why your study technique works (or doesn't). So we can change and adapt. After all what is the definition of Insanity?
