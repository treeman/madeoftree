All this time working on my latest game I thought it sucked and I was trying hard to make it to not suck. My spirit wasn't high, just check [this post](/blog/Incomplete_game_coming_up/) and [this](/blog/Going_down/) but now when it's done it's like night and day, or like black and white! I'm damn happy I got it done!! Aah I'll try to make this postmortem shorter than the last one... That was huge.

**Lessons I've learned**

+   *Levels take time*  
    I know you're all disappointed by a measly three levels in the game and for that I'm sorry. I hadn't set aside time for making the levels in my mental plan so when I ran over the time limit of 7 days I had to cut down on some stuff - this time it was the levels.

+   *A codebase rocks*  
    For my first game I had some basic code from older projects I used, like handling states, a small menu and a vector class among others and that saved me a whole lot of time. Now I had even more code so I got something on screen a lot faster and I could afford beginning with creating the dude and his animation (although I kinda overdid that) knowing I already had the basic foundation in place. Now I'm going to get my coding skillz up and the experience and this is another really big stone which will allow me to make bigger and more badass games later on.

+   *It might not suck so hard after all...*  
    In the beginning I was pretty confident but I quickly lost that momentum and I thought a lot about how sucky this game is... It's not polished, it's not fun and the levels suck etc but it turned out to be okay! I have to stop being so damn negative! These are experimental games for crying out loud, they're expected to fail once in a while and guess what? It doesn't matter!
