Well here I am in the end of the month - without a game. It's a failure I know but once again I lack inspiration and then it's really hard to do something. Instead I've been thinking of something I could do that would make me wanna code like really bad again. I'm thinking of patching up this website, the forums are bugging me like hell as I didn't write it, switching rendering framework for my games and just now today I've done a few [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) challenges in Haskell which was pretty fun (but hard as I'm really bad with it).

Next time I've got my sights on the [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/) which instead of a seven day game is a two day game! We'll see how that'll go.. If I have the power and the time to.

I've also written a small piece about the Evolution of RTS games, heavily shortened to fit a perfect 5 pages a feat I'm quite proud of. Of course I wanted to write a hell of a lot more.

In short: Not much has happened and not a lot is happening but we'll see what the future has in store.
