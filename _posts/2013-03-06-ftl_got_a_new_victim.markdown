{% excerpt %}

[Faster than Light][FTL] the great game [I lost a ton of time on][FTL_post], has found a new victim. It's not someone you'd expect, it's even someone who said: "What a bad game" when she saw me playing it. But nevertheless this Saturday she played it more than 2.5 hours!

I told Veronica I wanted her try out FTL and minecraft, but we never got time for minecraft... It was so funny seeing her, on the edge of the seat, mumbling "die, die, die" to herself when she's in battle and jumping up "hooray!" when she destroyed the enemy. Sadly she didn't beat the boss, but boy did she come close! FTL must be a hidden skill for her.

I'm looking forward to introduce her to minecraft. I just hope she won't get too addicted and turn into a clone of myself.
