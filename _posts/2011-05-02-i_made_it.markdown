It's been over a year, but I haven't lost (most) my touch yet! For the second time I've completed a [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/)! Not an easy feat and yet there are tons of games that look absolutely wonderful. I'm not there yet but now I have at least gotten back into game making again, long overdue.

I will make a formal post and all that jaz when I wake up tomorrow, or maybe I'll sleep the whole day... Nah not really, but at least a while.

[Here](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=1895)'s my entry btw, didn't turn out the way I wanted it to but in the end I'm quite satisfied. There are a ton of possibilities for it though.

Oh well. Nap time!
