It's the little things in life that makes it extra special. Sometimes it's the luxury of coffee together with the morning paper and other times it's just a small simple smile from a random stranger, kid or dog. Today when I got this bad headache I got saved by a two hour nap and my [Programming in Ada][ada] book. It was quite a pleasure to just read it and not worrying about anything else. I even think my headache disappeared a while there.

And if that wasn't enough, my long lost [Modern Perl][perl] is finally here! I've skimmed a little and boy I think I'm going to like this one. I'm soon up to two digits with my programming books and I really do like them. Even if I'm not doing anything in that particular language it's still fun to just read about. There's always something you'll learn and even if not I still find it soothing.

Reading books, threads, blog posts or random forum rants/wars about programming is sometimes coffee for my brain (I don't actually drink coffee or anything with caffeine. I'm almost feeling like an endangered programming species).

If the book is actually worth reading we'll see and I'll report back when I've gone through it.
