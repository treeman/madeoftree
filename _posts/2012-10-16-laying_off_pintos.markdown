{% excerpt %}

Exam period is here which means all courses should be wrapping up and a week or so ago we finished up [our lab series][lab] about [pintos][]. The labs were among the best I've had yet and I learned a ton. We didn't follow the official instructions but we had our own assigmnets. Basically:

1. Implement some basic system calls.
2. Reimplement `timer_sleep` to not use busy waiting.
3. Implement synchronization between processes, program arguments and securing the system calls.
    Yes quite a bit bigger than the rest.
4. Synchronize the file system.

All in all pretty darn fun. I was considering sharing the code publicly, but that might not be a too bright of an idea. I'll keep it private for now.
