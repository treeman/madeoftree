Back over at [The Experimental Gameplay Project](http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/) a new theme has come up. My last three themes haven't been "my" themes: I've been following their lead and their themes and this month is no exception. This months' apparently a big theme - **Art**. It's even a collaboration with a big art museum...

The idea that games are art is an old one and there are a few games considered art - but it's really hard to make an actual *art game*. But I'll try :)
