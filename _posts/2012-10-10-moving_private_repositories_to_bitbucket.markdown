{% excerpt %}

Long overdue, I recently moved my private repositories from [Github][] to [Bitbucket][]. Github is great of courseand they even gave me a free students account and I still host all my [public repositories][Github] there. Still, Bitbucket has unlimited free private repositories for up to 5 users which is a much better pricing model. And Bitbucket is pretty awesome as well, they're posting a lot on [hacker news][], my favourite place on the web. That's where the [final push][] came from anyway.

The transition was as smooth as a... a sine wave...? Pretty damn smooth that is. Sign up took 30 seconds, copy paste my ssh key and redefine some remotes and I'm basically done. Decentralized source code management (git in this case) is pretty damn awesome.
