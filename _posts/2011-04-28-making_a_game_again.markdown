I've gotta do a lab today at school, tomorrow I need to do the exam I missed when I had my glasses-missing headaches and I'm going to Ikea and some other shops for, you guessed it, shopping! Sure it's fun and sure I need to do these things but the only thing on my mind now is making a new game. This weekend [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) is on again and I would really, really like to enter it! It's been [over a year](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) since my last Ludum Dare and almost 11 months since my [last game](http://madeoftree.net/blog/wheres_teddy).

I want to make games again..

I can't promise a new game this weekend but I think I might have the time for some game creation on friday, saturday and sunday evening/night so I just might. The last time I even had a massage course the whole day on sunday/saturday so I should be fine.

This time I also think I can come up with some more sound and music compared to the last time (where I only had two thuds!). I got [LMMS](http://lmms.sourceforge.net/), a free music creation program. I really suck at making music though lol.

I haven't made a game since I switched to Slackware either, luckily [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) is cross platform. I've also got my old [7days library](https://github.com/treeman/7days), my collection of old game creating codebase which I was pretty proud of for a while.

For graphics I think I'm aiming for some pixelated cool stuff with [mtPaint](http://mtpaint.sourceforge.net/). Pixelated stuff looks awesome, if you're good at it, and I'd like to make something similar.. At least a little similar.

*Unreleased fun pixel graphics*</center>

So for a quick recap, if I'm going to make a game again this is what I'm going to use:  

1.  [LMMS](http://lmms.sourceforge.net/) for music
2.  [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) as the core game library (graphics, sound and input)
3.  [7days library](https://github.com/treeman/7days) for useful stuff
4.  [mtPaint](http://mtpaint.sourceforge.net/) for pixel graphics

As usual it'll be made in C++ (I might do something else another time) and I'll probably listen to *Raubtier, Sarah Brightman, Hans Zimmer* and some classical composers *(Mozart, Bach, Vivaldi etc)*.
