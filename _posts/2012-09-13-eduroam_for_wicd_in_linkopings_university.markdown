{% excerpt %}

So we have eduroam at our University and unsurprisingly wicd is not on their official support list but with some googling the wonderful [Arch Wiki][] had the answer. Well, almost.

[Arch Wiki]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wicd#Making_eduroam_work_with_wicd

{% endexcerpt %}

Save the following as `/etc/wicd/encryption/templates/ttls-80211`:

    name = TTLS for Wireless
    author = Alexander Clouter
    version = 1
    require anon_identity *Anonymous_Username identity *Identity password *Password
    optional ca_cert *Path_to_CA_Cert
    -----
    ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
    network={
        ssid="$_ESSID"
        scan_ssid=$_SCAN

        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        eap=TTLS

        ca_cert="$_CA_CERT"

        phase2="auth=MSCHAPv2 auth=PAP"

        anonymous_identity="$_ANON_IDENTITY"
        identity="$_IDENTITY"
        password="$_PASSWORD"
    }

Only difference from the wiki is the line `subject_match="$_CERT_SUBJECT"` is removed.

In a terminal:

    cd /etc/wicd/encryption/templates
    echo ttls-80211 >> active

Then open wicd (I use `wicd-curses`) and choose `TTLS for Wireless` under the security mode and enter your credentials [from this page][settings]. For the lazy people [download this][], save it somewhere and specify the path to it as `Path to CA Cert` then input your `<name>@liu.se` or `<name>@student.liu.se` and don't forget [your password][].

Done!
