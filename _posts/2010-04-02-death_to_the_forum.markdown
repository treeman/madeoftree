Well it was fun while it lasted, but now it's gone and it'll stay gone for a long time I think. It was mainly a test to see if I could do it and I'm really proud of my styling of it but it's deader than in a grave, which isn't really surprising, and it bothered me that I didn't write it myself - like really bothered me. 

[phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com/) is fantastic in many ways; easy, fast and easily managed but it just didn't feel right as I hadn't done it. Kinda the same as why I'm not using any popular blog tool but I've rolled my own. It feels pretty good to use a site you've written completely yourself...

And no I don't want to write my own forum now, for now I'll stick with a tweak here a tweak there on the site.
