This time I'll be following [my inspiring site](http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2009/08/and-the-theme-of-august-is/) and declare **Bare Minimum** as the theme for my next game. This could really be anything, from graphics to user interaction... But I've got an idea. It'll be a real challange for me to make but hopefully I'll have a game in a few weeks time.
