The [The Experimental Gameplay Project](http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/) drives on with the *Art Game* theme which will last the rest of this year but that's something we can't accept! I've done my game and I didn't force myself out from the Haskell world just to do nuthin so here's a new little theme for me :)

What does the U.S one dollar bill, the French Revolution and Zion have in common? It's the conspiracy *New World Order* of course!

The paranoid can find it anything so this shouldn't be a problem?    
*Right?!*
