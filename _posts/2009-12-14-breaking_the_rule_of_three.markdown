It's pretty darn stressful making a game in a week, especially when you have this big great vision on how your game should be (which is *always* grand). For me making *Balls*, *Black and White* and *Jonas IceCream Stand* where truly stressful, *MenuCity* and *Bugger* not so much but still.

This is why I'm giving me an early Christmas gift: *I won't make the December game in a week*. In fact I haven't even logged the hours, I just work on it a little here and a little there and boy it's nice not having to do something all the time.

But there are downsides of course. I'm breaking my rules which is... bad and I don't have that productivity boost I always get when under a deadline so now I'm pretty far behind.

But the screenshot looks promising doesn't it?
