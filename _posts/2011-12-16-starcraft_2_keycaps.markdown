When I ordered this computer I was compelled, utterly compelled to buy a mechanical keyboard. Sure they cost almost 10x as much as a "regular" one and they didn't even have these funky multimedia keys, what gives? Did I loose my insanity? It was supposed to give a great typing experience... And it sure did deliver!

I'm bringing this up again because I decided to spend my money on something possibly even more useless (or awesome?). I ordered some starcraft II modifier keys for the keyboard and now they are fitted onto the keyboard. Yay!
