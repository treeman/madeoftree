{% excerpt %}
Ludum Dare is coming along... Slowly. The rust on me is probably so brown it's nearly black. But I have an idea and it might be good, all I need to do is execute it. Right?

*Programmer graphics coming to take you away!*

Anyway it's going to be a risk-like game with a twist: you can change all the rules and victory conditions. I played a pretty cool card game where changing the rules was the core of the game, pretty neat idea actually. As for the theme I wanted to do something with robots taking over the world - it's only the next logic evolution of computers anyway.

Not sure if the game is going to be anything to celebrate over, but I'm having fun at least. Except for getting annoyed about C++ missing all my favourite features from other languages... But in time I'll be in love with it anyway.
