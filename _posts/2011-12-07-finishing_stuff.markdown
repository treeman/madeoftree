I haven't done much blogging or game programming in a while but instead I've finished some school stuff. We completed the assembly course labs, which were pretty fun actually, and I managed to finally complete the electronics course I've been holding off on for like forever... But now it's gone, yay!

There's not much left before christmas either, we have some sort of exam on tuesday (very boring course) and one the 20th (very fun course) but other than that I'm free to do whatever I want.

* I'm planning on entering [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) next weekend, finally getting some game programming done.
* I need to recap this year and plan some for the next. I fear this year wasn't as productive as I had hoped.
* I've been thinking that I know my tools (Vim, the command line) but I need to get a little bit better. Especially with emacs as I feel like a monkey on a typewriter when I'm forced to use it at school. Not cool.

And some more smaller stuff I don't have energy to type out (or maybe you're interested in reorganizing my home folder?).
