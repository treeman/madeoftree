Here's a collection of some projects I've made and like. Find more over at my [github profile][].

[7days][]
=======
A fast prototyping framework made in C++ and [SFML][]. I didn't develop it as much as it's a collection of stuff I've found useful when making games.

[MARC][]
======
Me and two other students made a VHDL implementation of the [Core Wars 88 standard (pdf)][corewars88]. Core Wars is basically a computer game where two programs compete and try to destroy each other. Read [the wiki][corewarswiki] for more info. We designed a microprogrammed processor with a Redcode assembler and wrote some warriors for it.

[dotfiles][]
=========
Take a look at my config files for stuff [here][dotfiles]. Some are incomplete and unused, but others such as [.vimrc][] are more complete. I also have my [xmonad][] dual screen setup and some scripts for the desktop there.

[Treebot][]
========
An old irc bot with funny quotes and various information scraping like a new manga and tv-series tracker. A bit more to it than the [simplebot][].
