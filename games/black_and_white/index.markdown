Here it is at last! Boasting a unoriginal name, themed *Bare Minimum*. My thoughts where to create a game where graphics where included into the gameplay but sadly it didn't come out nearly as good as I expected it too.

Yes I know there are a lot of things bad and wrong with this game, but this is a competition with myself to create a game in only seven days and you can't always polish the games like your heart tells you to do.

**Instructions**   
Move left and right with the arrows, jump with space and change the blocks with enter. Esc into the menu and there you can enter a highly advanced (not) level editor to change the levels however you want with left and right mouse.
