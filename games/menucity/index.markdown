This game is called MenuCity and it's a numbers game. Well that's the theme anyway. The game pretty much held to what I planned for - except that it deviated from the theme -again- a bit.

My game is very reminiscent of the old calculator classic *Block Dude* made by Brandon Sterner. If you like that game, or any puzzle game for that matter, you're gonna love this one.
