Ahhh... Finally another game! Theme of this beauty is *Failure* and your mission here is to avoid the bugs. As a programmer the fight with those nasty bugs are a daily occurrence and now I've brought you a chance to kill those nasties too!

The gameplay wasn't what I was planning on - yet again - but I'm actually quite content with the game. It's able to grab your attention for at least a few minutes before loosing you and it's absolutely the prettiest one I've ever made! Enjoy! ^^

Type the text on the bugs to make them disappear, that's all folks!
