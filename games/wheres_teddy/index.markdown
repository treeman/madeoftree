So I did this course Game Design and what's a course on Game Design without a game? Well, here it is. Made in about seven days (more likely eight) and I thought it became quite cool.

**Where's Teddy?**

**How to Play**   
Your mission is to find teddy and his teddybear friends. The problem is that it's dark and it's really hard to find them if you can't see where you're going but thankfully you have a candle with you and if you're lucky you can stumble on more candles to keep you from going completely dark.

**Controls**   
Move with *Arrow Keys*   
Switch and light candles with *Space*   
Next Level: *N*   
Previous Level: *P*   
Reset Level: *R*   
Console: *F1*
