    Me and two other students made a VHDL implementation of the [Core Wars 88 standard][corewars88]. Core Wars is basically a computer game where two programs compete and try to destroy each other. Read [the wiki][corewarswiki] for more info. We designed a microprogrammed processor with a Redcode assembler and wrote some warriors for it.
